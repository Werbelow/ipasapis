### IPA API Hackathon Submission 

My hackathon app was all about helping a fellow beer drinker learn more about their favorite Avery beers, what pairs well with it, where to find it near them and give them the ability to favorite and rate those beers. I know that I tend to find a beer that I enjoy, but quickly forget the name of it, this app helps a user rate and favorite those beers, so they know what to order next time the are out. 

I was one of only two? solo teams, but had a blast challenging myself to see what I could make in 24 hours. 

App is built with Swift (native iOS app).
I also used a tool called [Realm.io](www.realm.io) for storing the ratings and favorites. 

### I used the following CocoaPods:

* [JSONJOy-Swift](https://github.com/daltoniam/JSONJoy-Swift) - helps with JSON parsing from the API
* [SwiftHTTP](https://github.com/daltoniam/SwiftHTTP) - Helps with making API requests 
* [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) - Image downloading and caching
